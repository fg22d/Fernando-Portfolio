# Fernando-Portfolio
Showcasing some of my Data Analytics projects to show proficiency in industry skills and tools 

# [Project 1: Kaggle Competition: Novozymes Enzyme Stability Prediction](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Qmj3DgOgoaARsjxERBxO35f8eJePev-y)
• Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using statistical summaries and visualizations to identify patterns and variables relevant to
enzyme thermostability.
• Employed statistical modeling techniques to develop predictive models for enzyme thermostability, leveraging regression analysis and
machine learning algorithms.
