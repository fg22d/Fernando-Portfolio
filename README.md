# Fernando_Portfolio
Showcasing some of my Data Analytics projects to show proficiency in industry skills and tools 

# [Project 1: Kaggle Competition: Novozymes Enzyme Stability Prediction](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Qmj3DgOgoaARsjxERBxO35f8eJePev-y)
• Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using statistical summaries and visualizations to identify patterns and variables relevant to
enzyme thermostability.<br>
• Employed statistical modeling techniques to develop predictive models for enzyme thermostability, leveraging regression analysis and
machine learning algorithms. <br>

# [Project 2: Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis Model](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_77R-lojVZFk8ZQ5qbx15E1GDCLidmc-)
• Performed preprocessing on Amazon review data including tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal, and fixing contractions. <br>
• Compared multiple classification models including decision trees and neural networks to predict sentiment from reviews. Achieved over 80% accuracy. <br>
• Implemented a sentiment analysis dictionary-based approach using VADER. Achieved 83% accuracy in classifying positive and negative reviews. <br>
